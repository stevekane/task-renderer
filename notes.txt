I want to explore creating a discrete time interval for updates
24 frames per second means that I will setInterval(update, 24).
Inside the callback I will poll the system clock to determine if
a reasonable amount of time has elapsed (24 += 3ms?) and will set
the value of dT to 1 (meaning 1 frame).  This allows for a more
reliable way of expressing what a timeline function should DO (function
of elapsed frames.  Makes this a discrete idempotent function.

How to handle scrubbing against variable-length component

IO these frames are noted in sequences but execute in "0" frames
from the point of view of a scrubber.  This means that they will just be 
"skipped" over when scrubbing through them in the timeline view.  

Audio files do NOT play in the viewer when scrubbing.  They are simply 
discounted as events which take 0 frames to execute.

Considering any variable-length event to take precisely zero frames 
to complete allows us to retain meaningful scrubbing within a sequence
which is essential for animators to place keyframes and view their work
in the authoring tool.
